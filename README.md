# DSA210---Term-Project
Books have a big part in our daily lives. The aim of this project is to look through book reviews and analyize the trends of various book genres. Through analyzing book reviews a pattern can be found within different genres and their popularity.
Dataset for the project will be taken from Goodreads, and to enrich another set of data, for example from Amazon Book Reviews, will be used. In order to analyize book reviews Natural Language Processing is planned to use. 

For the datasets:
    - Kaggle was used to get the datasets for GoodReads and Amazon Rviews
    - The downloaded data is added to the project folder and code files created to process the 
    datasets and created new files by editing them according to the needed main infromations for the project which are; book name, (if in a series) series name, book length, review
